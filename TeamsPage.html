    <section id="Hull">
        <h2>Hull Team</h2>
        <p>The hull team focuses on a combination of hull design, testing and manufacturing alongside the important integration of the propulsion and control team.</p><br>
        <p>The current design takes inspiration from an aircraft space frame sub structure, combined with an aluminium sheet skin for midbody section and a 3D printed skin in the tail section.</p><br>
        <p></p>
    </section>
    <section id="Propulsion">
        <h2>Propulsion Team</h2>
        <p>In our sub team we deal with the submarine's propeller and how we can move through the water the fastest. We work closely with the transmission team to determine the optimum blade design and appropriate rotation speeds.</p><br>
        <pâ€‹>This year, we have been designing an all new propellor to be fitted to Tsunami, building from our previous extensive experience in producing propellors on Tempest and beyond.</p><br>
        <p></p>
    </section>

    <section id="Transmission">
        <h2>Transmission Team</h2>
        <p>The transmission team focuses on the transfer of power from the pedals to the drive train and the propellors, leading to us being closely related to the propulsion team in order to create a efficient design. We are currently designing an all new system based off a belt drive and trying to slim down the overall design in order to fit and work in our new submarine.</p><br>
        <p></p>
    </section>

    <section id="Control">
        <h2>Control Team</h2>
        <p>The control team is in charge of the control surfaces and the pilot's interfaces with them. We are currently working on a fly-by-wire system using joysticks, an Arduino and some servos to provide an effortless and reliable driving system. We are also looking at the design of the fins and how best to guide the submarine passively to reduce the workload on the pilot.</p><br>
        <p></p>
    </section>

    <section id="Diving">
        <h2>Diving Team</h2>
        <p>We have a dedicated team of divers including the submarine pilot and support divers. All our divers are PADI/BSAC qualified.</p><br>
        <p></p>
    </section>


    <section id="Finance">
        <h2>Finance Team</h2>
        <p>The finance team focuses on connecting our team with sponsors and raising funds for the society as well as organising and subsidising events and socials run by the society. Additionally, involved in decisions surrounding the design of the submarine and being the main liaison between Southampton University Student Union finance team and the society itself. </p><br>
